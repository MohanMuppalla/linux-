History (gives the list of previously executed commands).
The `cat` command prints the contents of a file without opening it, providing a quick way to view file contents.
Vim  {command is used to create and edit files in the command line. Entering "insert mode" allows you to type text, and pressing "esc" returns to command mode}
Execute a shell script using either `sh scriptname` or `./scriptname`. The latter is used for executable files. Make sure to set execute permissions using `chmod +x scriptname` if needed.

Linux requires proper permissions to execute files. Use `chmod` to assign read, write, and execute permissions for different user categories: user, group, and others. Numeric values like 777 or 444 represent these permissions.
Ô∏è `chmod` permissions follow the 4-2-1 convention: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. Use these values to grant permissions to different users.
how to go to the command terminal after opening the vim and editor mode: 
step1: first click on the esc now type :wq which is write and quit
chmod 777 -- here each  digit indicates 4+2+1 [write+read+execute access] to the user+group+team.
 ./filename [command to execute the script written in the file]
df -h [printing the available disk space in the  VM]
free -g [shows the free  memory available]
nproc [numbers of cpu's available in the VM]
top [shows all the running sleeping and stopped process in the VM]
TOP command can be considered as the command which helps to check the status of the node..
whenever you are writting a script ina file mandatory steps you need to follow is writting the meta data 
and when we execute a script file lets say we have written a file df -h, free -g,nproc and execute the file then we will get the output in the terminal
but the user will have no idea what commands are executed... to remove this confusion we have two options 
option 1: we can write echo right before the command... lets say df -h for this we will write [echo(we are printing the available disk space)]
option2 : we can directly give a command "set -x" which runs in debug mode and  shows the commands which have given along with the output. 
what are processes in any system? 
lets say we are opening youtube in the chrome and facebook in the mozilla these are two process and in the VM world there will be manymore processws
will be running in the background.. in the windows we can directly search and find all the processs that are running but in linux we have
ps -ef [command to check what all processes are running in the VM]
ps -f | grep "amazon" [this grep command is used for narrow searching it results all the process runnning with name amazon]
pipe command "|" will send the output of the  first command to the second command  
Q? why cant pipe work for the date command?
lets say we have given the date command it gives the today's date...what if i give date | echo today's date is
it will only print today's date is it does not give date because date is a default command sends it's output to the stdin. but | cannot pull
output from the stdin.. it can only take output for those commands which are ready to give the output..
awk command [we use grep command to get the whole information which has that specific word which we have given..to get only specific coulumns
in the output rows we use awk command]
ps -ef | grep "amazon" | awk -f  "" '{print $4}'    [this prints the 4th coulmn information from all the rows]
there will thousands of applications will be running in the VM what we do when one of the application fails we go check the log files
cat logfile | grep error [this will not provide any list because we dont know where the log file]
each institiution use their own log file storage location like aws stores in S3 and azure in blob ...etc
so to get this we use a command   curl "location url" | grep error curl command will get the information frm the internet
simillarly like postman tool and "requests module" in python curl is used for making API calls 
curl -X GET api.food.com [this command will retrievev all the information present in food api]
man curl [will give all the  information about the curl command]
wget "file location" [when we use this command it downloads the log file in some file directory unlike the curl command it don't print the information]
we now need to grep the downloaded logfile to get the information
