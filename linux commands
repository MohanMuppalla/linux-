History (gives the list of previously executed commands).
The `cat` command prints the contents of a file without opening it, providing a quick way to view file contents.
Vim  {command is used to create and edit files in the command line. Entering "insert mode" allows you to type text, and pressing "esc" returns to command mode}
Execute a shell script using either `sh scriptname` or `./scriptname`. The latter is used for executable files. Make sure to set execute permissions using `chmod +x scriptname` if needed.

Linux requires proper permissions to execute files. Use `chmod` to assign read, write, and execute permissions for different user categories: user, group, and others. Numeric values like 777 or 444 represent these permissions.
Ô∏è `chmod` permissions follow the 4-2-1 convention: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. Use these values to grant permissions to different users.
how to go to the command terminal after opening the vim and editor mode: 
step1: first click on the esc now type :wq which is write and quit
chmod 777 -- here each  digit indicates 4+2+1 [write+read+execute access] to the user+group+team.
 ./filename [command to execute the script written in the file]
df -h [printing the available disk space in the  VM]
free -g [shows the free  memory available]
nproc [numbers of cpu's available in the VM]
top [shows all the running sleeping and stopped process in the VM]
TOP command can be considered as the command which helps to check the status of the node..
whenever you are writting a script ina file mandatory steps you need to follow is writting the meta data 
and when we execute a script file lets say we have written a file df -h, free -g,nproc and execute the file then we will get the output in the terminal
but the user will have no idea what commands are executed... to remove this confusion we have two options 
option 1: we can write echo right before the command... lets say df -h for this we will write [echo(we are printing the available disk space)]
option2 : we can directly give a command "set -x" which runs in debug mode and  shows the commands which have given along with the output.
